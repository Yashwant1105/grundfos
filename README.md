# Grundfos - Chiller Load Prediction System

## 📜 Project Overview

The **Grundfos** app is designed to optimize the cooling efficiency in large commercial buildings like hotels, malls, hospitals, and IT complexes. As the world moves towards sustainability, this app leverages machine learning to predict chiller load requirements, reducing unnecessary energy consumption and minimizing carbon footprints. 

## 🛠️ Problem Statement

Chiller plants are critical for providing comfort cooling in large buildings. However, running chillers at full capacity, regardless of actual demand, leads to wasted energy and increased costs. The goal of this project is to estimate chiller loads based on factors like hotel occupancy, outside weather conditions, and day of the week, thereby enabling energy-efficient operations.

## 🚀 Key Features

1. **Chiller Load Prediction**: 
   - Users can input parameters such as chiller plant power, atmospheric humidity, and total chiller power.
   - The app uses a machine learning model trained on historical data to predict the chiller load.

2. **Visual Analytics**: 
   - The app provides graphical representations of chiller loads throughout the year, helping managers visualize patterns and optimize operations.

## 🖥️ How It Works

- The app takes user inputs related to the current operating environment.
- It processes these inputs through a machine learning model to predict the optimal chiller load.
- Results are displayed in an easy-to-understand format, with charts and graphs providing insights into energy consumption.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Flutter**
- **Dart**

### Backend
